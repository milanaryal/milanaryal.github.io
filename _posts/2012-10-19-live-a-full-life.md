10 ways to raise your consciousness and enjoy every moment of life ---

#### Forgive yourself and others

Life is too short to hold on to regrets, grudges, miscommunications, or disappointments. Free yourself by forgiving and letting go of any negative energy you are holding on to about yourself or others. The process of forgiving yourself and others will result in your feeling light and free.

#### Practice gratitude and appreciation

Whatever you focus on grows. So when you focus on everything in your life, you feel grateful for all and appreciate the wonderful people, the universe hands you more to feel grateful about.

#### Live each day as through it were your last

Then you will be living in a state of love and unconditional contribution. What would you say to the people you care about? Say it.

#### Mediate or pray

You open up a direct link between yourself and the spiritual realm when you mediate or pray. You will come closer to your creator, experience peace, clarity and joy, as well as perfectly balanced state between your mental, physical, emotional and spiritual realms.

#### Suspend judgement

One judges another to feel less guilty about one's own misgivings. Judgement energy is dense, dark and heavy. On the other hand, unconditional acceptance is light and free. Let go of judging and criticising yourself and others. Everyone is on a different path and some appear to be farther ahead on their path than others. Neither path is better nor worse than another. Raise your consciousness to one of acceptance.

#### View every experience as a gift

If you look back at occurrences in your life, you can easily see how even the worst situations you experienced in your life ended up teaching you invaluable lessons and therefore resulted in putting you in perfect place for your continuing development. When you view every experience --- the good, the bad, and the ugly as a gift, life flows more like a gentle, inspiring breeze.

#### Stay consciously aware of all your thoughts and feelings

It is easy to fall into negative pattern of complaining and feelings like a victim of society and your life. When you catch yourself in the negative zone, don't feel badly about it and bother yourself too much. Simply choose to switch your consciousness to one of gratitude and positive thinking.

#### Treat your physical body as your temple

Your body is the only vehicle you've been given for this ride called life. The better you care for your body by eating a healthy, balanced diet, and by implementing a regular exercise routine, and by giving your body the rest it requires, the more you will experience increased energy, vitality, joy and freedom.

#### View the world through the eyes of a child

Children are enthralled by the process of observing and experiencing the wonder and beauty in every single thing. They can't get enough. Look at every tree, sunset, cloud and human being as a child would and you'll be in a constant state of wonder, joy, surprise, acceptance and enlightenment.

#### Give love from your heart

It's all about love. Love is the highest form of human emotion. Allow yourself to receive love unconditionally from others. Give love from your heart unconditionally to yourself and to others. You will experience the highest state of consciousness possible.
