When things go wrong as they sometimes will, we all need words of encouragement. To spring back again to complete our fight and move on towards the path of our life. And here are some words of encouragement you never know how can they affect your life.

"One has to remember that every failure can be a stepping stone to something better." --- *Col Harland Sanders*

"When you get into a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hang on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the place and time that the tide will turn." --- *Harriet Beecher Stowe*

"A diamond is merely a lump of coal that did well under pressure." --- *Unknown*

"I am grateful for all of my problems. After each one was overcome, I became stronger and more able to meet those that were still to come. I grew in all my difficulties." --- *James Cash Penney*

"A bend in the road is not the end of the road... unless you fail to make the turn." --- *Unknown*
