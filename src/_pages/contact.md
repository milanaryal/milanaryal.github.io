If you want to ask a question, offer feedback, or would just like to say hello in general, then please [contact me on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/milanaryal/){: rel="me"}. You can also [find me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/milanaryal){: rel="me"}, but I respond less frequently there. If those options don't work for you, please know that I genuinely do appreciate your support and interest in my work.

And if you haven't already figured it out, this is my personal website of which I'm the sole author. I don't take guest posts, advertising, or requests to promote anything.
