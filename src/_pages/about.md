Hey --- this is Milan Aryal (‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§® ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§≤), who is passionate about capital market (esp. [stock trading](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(finance)>){:rel="nofollow"}) and front-end web development (esp. [Jamstack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamstack){:rel="nofollow"}) based in Kathmandu, Nepal.

> The name Milan (pronounced MEE-lahn), means dear, loving and gracious in Slavic; in Ancient Roman, eager and laborious; and in Sanskrit, unification.

Writing articles is hard, but making up designs is fun. I made this site so I would be able to do both.

Nothing brings me more pleasure than making something out of nothing. Even when the results are far from my ideal expectations, I find the whole ceremony of creativity completely enthralling.

I'd like to think that I'm very happy person, but I find the art that strikes me truest is the sad, depressing sort, I love hip-hop and R&B music, post-apocalyptic fiction, and movie trailers that can make me squirt tears in under two minutes. Go figure.
