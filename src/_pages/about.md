Hey --- this is Milan Aryal (मिलन अर्याल). I am just a simple person living a regular and simple life, based in Kathmandu, Nepal.

> The name Milan (pronounced MEE-lahn), means dear, loving and gracious in Slavic; in Ancient Roman, eager and laborious; and in Sanskrit, unification.

If you want to ask any questions ([Q&A](/qna/)), or would just like to say hello in general, my [contact page](/contact/) has all those details.

Writing articles is hard, but making up designs is fun. I made this site so I would be able to do both.

Nothing brings me more pleasure than making something out of nothing. Even when the results are far from my ideal expectations, I find the whole ceremony of creativity completely enthralling.
