Short codes are used to dial or send a message for subscribing offers, packages and additional functionalities/features of mobile network operators. There are several USSD codes, SMS codes and calling numbers.

> USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) codes are sometimes known as "quick codes" or "feature codes" --- they send text between a mobile phone and an application program in-network. Every operator/carrier will have an individual list of mobile USSD codes.
>
> For example: How to check Namaste balance? Use USSD code(s) `*400#` to check your prepaid and postpaid account balance.

In this post, I have tried to collect all of the essential numbers/codes for the mobile Telecom services subscription in Nepal.
