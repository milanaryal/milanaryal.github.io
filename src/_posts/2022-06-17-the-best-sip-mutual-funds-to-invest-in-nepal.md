The best SIP funds is a list of hand-picked open-ended mutual fund schemes that have given better SIP returns compared to other funds in Nepal.

> A systematic investment plan (SIP) is an investment scheme where you can invest a certain sum at regular intervals, namely quarterly, monthly, or weekly.

This means these funds stick to their investment philosophy in difficult times and aren't afraid of temporary correction in the prices of the stocks in their portfolios and hence generate better returns over long term for their SIP investors.
