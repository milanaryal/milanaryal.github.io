All of these providers are either free, or have a decent free plan.

### [CloudFlare](http://www.cloudflare.com/dns){:rel="nofollow"}

Probably one of the largest free DNS hosting providers, no premium charges unless you get into some of their advanced CDN features. But they are also technically a managed DNS host which means you don't have as much control. However, they do provide you with additional security features such as rate limiting, filtering, and blocking. Cloudflare's speeds are also faster than most premium DNS providers.
