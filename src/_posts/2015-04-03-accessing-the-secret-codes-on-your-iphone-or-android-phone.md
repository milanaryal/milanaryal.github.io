Here are some codes you can dial into the phone app that will access hidden information and menus in the iPhone or Android phone.

Most of the time, they allow the OEM or programmer to get into the system for troubleshooting when other, usual modes of access have been blocked. They can be quite friendly and helpful if you know what you're doing. Be advised, though, that some of these can cause serious changes to your device's configuration, so don't play with something that you don't fully understand.
