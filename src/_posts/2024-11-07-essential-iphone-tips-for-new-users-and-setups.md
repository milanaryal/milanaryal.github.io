This guide will walk you through essential tips and tricks to help you make the most of your iPhone. From setup basics to must-know features, we've got everything you need.

### Turn On Battery Percentage

To show the battery percentage on an iPhone, follow these steps:

<img src="/uploads/20241107-ios-turn-on-battery-percentage.png" alt="ios-turn-on-battery-percentage" width="215" height="466" />

1. **Open Settings**: Go to your iPhone's _Settings_ app.
2. **Go to Battery**: Scroll down and select _Battery_.
3. **Enable Battery Percentage**: Toggle on the _Battery Percentage_ option.

On iPhone models with Face ID (iPhone X and later), the percentage will show within the battery icon in the top-right corner of the screen. For other iPhone models, it appears next to the battery icon.

Alternatively, on models with Face ID, you can also view the battery percentage by swiping down from the top-right corner to open the Control Center.

### Turn On Optimized Battery Charging

To turn on **Optimized Battery Charging** on your iPhone:

2. **Select Battery**: Scroll down and tap _Battery_.
3. **Go to Battery Health & Charging**: Tap on _Battery Health & Charging_.
4. **Enable Optimized Battery Charging**: Toggle on _Optimized Battery Charging_.

This feature helps to reduce battery aging by learning your charging routine and delaying charging past 80% until you need it. It's designed to extend your battery's lifespan.

### Adjust Display Brightness to Automatic

To adjust display brightness, switch to Light mode, and enable automatic adjustments on an iPhone, follow these steps:

<img src="/uploads/20241107-ios-adjust-display-brightness-to-automatic.png" alt="ios-adjust-display-brightness-to-automatic" width="215" height="466" />

**1. Turn On Light Mode**:

- Go to _Settings_ > _Display & Brightness_.
- Under _Appearance_, select _Light_ to switch to Light mode.

**2. Enable Automatic Brightness**:

- Go to _Settings_ > _Accessibility_ > _Display & Text Size_.
- Scroll down and turn on _Auto-Brightness_. This will allow your iPhone to adjust the brightness based on ambient lighting conditions.

**3. Enable Light Until Sunset (Scheduled Appearance)**:

- Go to _Settings_ > _Display & Brightness_.
- Under _Appearance_, turn on _Automatic_.
- Tap _Options_ and select _Light Until Sunset_ to automatically switch between Light and Dark mode based on the time of day (Light mode during the day and Dark mode at night).

These settings ensure that your iPhone adjusts brightness automatically and shifts between Light and Dark modes based on the time of day.

### Setup Night Shift

To set up **Night Shift** on your iPhone to activate from sunset to sunrise:

1. **Open Settings**: Go to your _Settings_ app.
2. **Go to Display & Brightness**: Select _Display & Brightness_.
3. **Select Night Shift**: Tap on _Night Shift_.
4. **Schedule to Sunset to Sunrise**: Under _Scheduled_, toggle it on, then choose _Sunset to Sunrise_.

This setting will automatically adjust your display to warmer tones at night, reducing blue light to help reduce eye strain and improve sleep quality.

### Enable Automatic Dark Icons at Night

To enable automatic dark icons at night on your iPhone running iOS 18, follow these steps:

<img src="/uploads/20241107-ios-enable-automatic-dark-icons.png" alt="ios-enable-automatic-icon-theme" width="215" height="466" />

1. **Long-press** on an empty area of your Home screen.
2. Tap **Edit** in the top-left corner.
3. Select **Customize** from the menu that appears.
4. Choose **Automatic**. If you select **Automatic**, the dark icons will only appear at night.

With this setting, your iPhone will automatically switch between light and dark icons based on your device's Dark Mode schedule. This typically activates in the evening and deactivates in the morning. This feature not only gives your Home screen a sleek look but also helps reduce eye strain in low-light conditions.

**Note**:

- Some apps may not have specific dark mode icons. In such cases, iOS 18 will automatically generate a dark version of the icon using machine learning.
- The effectiveness of automatic dark icons depends on the app's icon design and whether the developer has provided a specific dark mode version.

### Turn Off Help Apple Improve Search

To turn off **Help Apple Improve Search** on your iPhone, follow these steps:

<img src="/uploads/20241107-ios-turn-off-help-apple-improve-search.png" alt="ios-turn-off-help-apple-improve-search" width="215" height="466" />

1. **Open the Settings app** on your iPhone.
2. **Scroll down and tap on "Search"**.
3. **Find "Help Apple Improve Search"** and toggle it off.

This will help enhance your privacy by preventing Apple from storing your search queries from Safari, Siri, and other sources.

### Turn Off Allow Apps to Request to Track

To turn off **Allow Apps to Request to Track** on your iPhone:

<img src="/uploads/20241107-ios-turn-off-allow-apps-to-request-to-track.png" alt="ios-turn-off-allow-apps-to-request-to-track" width="215" height="466" />

2. **Go to Privacy & Security**: Scroll down and tap _Privacy & Security_.
3. **Select Tracking**: Tap on _Tracking_.
4. **Turn Off Allow Apps to Request to Track**: Toggle off _Allow Apps to Request to Track_.

This setting prevents apps from asking for permission to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites.

### Turn Off In-App Ratings & Reviews

<img src="/uploads/20241107-ios-turn-off-in-app-ratings-and-reviews.png" alt="ios-turn-off-in-app-ratings-and-reviews" width="215" height="466" />

1. **Open Settings**: Go to your _Settings_ app.
2. **Go to App Store**: Scroll down and tap _App Store_.
3. **Disable In-App Ratings & Reviews**: Scroll down and toggle off _In-App Ratings & Reviews_.

This will stop apps from prompting you to rate or review them while you're using them.

### Set Maximum Volume

In iOS 18.2, Apple introduced a feature to set a maximum volume limit for your iPhone's built-in speakers, designed to protect your hearing and prevent unexpected loud audio. Here's how to enable it:

<img src="/uploads/20241107-set-maximum-volume.png" alt="ios-set-maximum-volume.png" width="215" height="466" />

1. Open the **Settings** app.
2. Go to **Sounds & Haptics**.
3. Scroll down and tap **Volume Limit** under the **Built-In Speaker** section.
4. Toggle on **Limit Maximum Volume**.
5. Use the slider to set your preferred maximum volume (options range from 20% to 90% in 10% increments).

This setting affects media playback (e.g., music, videos, podcasts, and audiobooks) but does not apply to phone calls, FaceTime, emergency alerts, ringtones, alarms, or system sounds.
