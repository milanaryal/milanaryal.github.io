Here's a curated list of an anonymous publishing platform for instant writing a post online without the need of signing an account.

#### [Telegraph](https://telegra.ph/){:rel="nofollow"}

Telegra.ph, a web app by the same authors as Telegram that lets you create and share a post very quickly and easily, without the need of an account. With it, you just enter a title, an author name, text that can be formatted kind of like with markdown, you hit publish and it's done. The web app also supports embedding links, YouTube or Vimeo videos and Tweets.

It's a minimalist publishing tool that allows you to create richly formatted posts and push them to the Web in just a click. Telegraph posts also get beautiful Instant View pages on Telegram.

Please note, editing can only be done as long as your current browser session is active.

#### [txt.fyi](https://txt.fyi/){:rel="nofollow"}

txt.fyi is the dumbest publishing platform on the web. Write something, hit publish, and it's live. It also supports basic Markdown to format posts easily.

There's no tracking, ad-tech, webfonts, analytics, javascript, cookies, databases, user accounts, comments, friending, likes, follower counts or other quantifiers of social capital. The only practical way for anyone to find out about a posting is if the author links to it elsewhere.

Here you can scream into the void and know the form of your voice is out there forever.

#### [Write.as](https://write.as/new){:rel="nofollow"}

Write.as lets you write and publish text instantly. Write a note for yourself to read later. Create a standalone article you can quickly broadcast on social media --- or publish a full blog.

Write.as takes the distraction out of writing on other platforms and provides a calm place with your words. Then if you want the world to see them, it's as easy as sharing a link. Privacy is built in to every corner --- you don't even have to sign up to use it. Just open the app, write something, and publish.
