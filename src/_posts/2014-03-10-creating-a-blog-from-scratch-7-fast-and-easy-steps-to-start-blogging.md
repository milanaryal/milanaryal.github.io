Creating a blog from scratch? How you can setup your blog and start making money? This is the 7 easy and fast steps to start blogging and make money from it.

Blog are online journals. They are used as short form of web logs which means a list of writings on the Internet. When all the writing is combined together to give it a look like a small website it is called a blog. A blog can be comprised of news, articles, personal diary. Below are the 7 steps to start creating a blog from scratch.

#### 1) Choose your blog niches

First thing you should do is to search on the topic you interested or have experienced in such as blogging such as dog training, golf swing etc.

#### 2) Buy a domain name

Then go to domain marketplace such as _GoDaddy_ or _Namecheap_, choose the relevant domain name related to your blog example if you interested in blogging on drawing I suggest that you buy domain name such as “drawingapicture.com, drawingforfun.com, howtodrawing.com”. The cost for buying a .com name is around $10–$40 depend on the domain marketplace.

#### 3) Open a hosting account

Then you need to link the blog together with its hosting account. You can open a hosting account for just around \$10 monthly and it can be used for multiple domain names.

#### 4) Choose blog platform

Creating a blog from scratch is easy, choose a blog platform or interface that you find easy and nice for you. I recommend you to use either WordPress, Blogger or Tumblr. For me WordPress is much more better because it is search engine friendly.

#### 5) Search a theme

If you want your blog to look more great, you can find a theme or template that is relevant to your blog content. There are free and also paid theme, for me I suggest if you want to manage your blog easily use the paid one, but if just want to test the waters you can use the free one. If you need to do a custom theme you can also find it and the service will cost you around $50 – $80 depending on the web designer.

#### 6) Publish your blog

Then make sure you create content that is relevant to your blog, let say if you’re in dog training you can publish about dog training, dog food, dog health and etc. Please do not mix up your blog with irrelevant content let say you’re blogging about golf and your content is about how to diet, how to sleep well, hoe to make money. This is not relevant and the reader will go away from your blog!

#### 7) Monetize your blog

How you can make money with your blog is to add some affiliate link from CPA Program, PPS Program, you can also promote an eBook on your blog. Other way that you can make money from is to set up a page that consist an ecommerce store, many of the bloggers will use amazon associates and include it in their own blog. It is free to set up an _amazon.com_.

Creating a blog from scratch is not hard if you follow the steps that I mention above. These are the steps that is still used until today that make all the bloggers success in blogging.
