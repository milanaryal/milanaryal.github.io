If you don't want your number to be searchable in the Truecaller app, then this post is for you.

Following steps will help you to remove your phone number details from the Truecaller database server.

You can opt-out from the Truecaller database through this [link](https://www.truecaller.com/unlisting){:rel="nofollow"}.

Note: If you have used Truecaller on your phone, please deactivate your account first:

- **On Android:** Tap on the 3 stripe menu > Settings > Privacy Center.
- **On iPhone:** Tap on the profile avatar (upper left) > Settings > Privacy Center.
  It can take up to 24 hours before your number gets removed. Numbers marked as spam cannot be unlisted.

### [I've unlisted a number but it's still searchable](https://support.truecaller.com/support/solutions/articles/81000392601-i-ve-unlisted-a-number-but-it-s-still-searchable){:rel="nofollow"}

If your number is still searchable on Truecaller after you have deactivated & _unlisted_, it can be due to the following reasons:

1. If you are a Truecaller user you need to _deactivate_ your account from the app.

2. It may take up to 24 hours before it's removed due to caching processes.

3. The profile could be locally cached (saved) on the device you are searching on. So you need to empty your search results on that device and try again. Alternatively, clear the cache memory of the device via the "phone settings > apps> Truecaller".
