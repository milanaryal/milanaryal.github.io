Here's a list of some best modern free and open source cross-platform code editors for developers.

### Visual Studio Code

_Free and open source IDE based on the Electron/Atom Framework. Created by Microsoft._

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:rel="nofollow"} combines the streamlined UI of a modern editor with rich code assistance and navigation, and an integrated debugging experience --- without the need for a full IDE. It uses the Electron framework based on the Atom shell.

VS Code combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.
