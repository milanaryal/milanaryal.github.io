Here's a list of best websites which offer free continuous deployment service with Git for modern static and Jamstack websites.

### [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/about/){:rel="nofollow"}

All sites on Netlify are prebuilt for performance and deployed directly to our global edge network --- without requiring you to manage, scale, or patch any web servers. This enables a revolutionary new architecture called the Jamstack, designed to make the web faster --- and to support the new tools and workflows used in modern web development.

### [Vercel](https://vercel.com/about){:rel="nofollow"}

Vercel is the optimal workflow for frontend teams. It offers all-in-one services: static and Jamstack deployment, serverless functions, and global CDN.

### [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/){:rel="nofollow"}

GitLab Pages are public web pages for users, organizations, and repositories, that are freely hosted on GitLab's `gitlab.io` domain or on a custom domain name of your choice. To publish a website with GitLab Pages, you can use any SSG, like Gatsby, Jekyll, Hugo, Middleman, Harp, Hexo, and Brunch, just to name a few. You can also publish any website written directly in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for free.

### [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:rel="nofollow"}

GitHub Pages are public web pages for users, organizations, and repositories, that are freely hosted on GitHub's `github.io` domain or on a custom domain name of your choice. GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll behind the scenes, so they're a great way to host your Jekyll-powered website for free.
