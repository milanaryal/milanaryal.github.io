### C-ASBA

C-ASBA means "Centralised Application Supported by Blocked Amount". ASBA is an application containing an authorization to block the application money in the bank account (Saving Account and Current Account without Overdraft facility), for subscribing to an issue (IPO/FPO/Rights). If an investor is applying through ASBA, his/her application money shall be debited from the bank account only if his/her application is selected for allotment after the basis of allotment is finalized.

<!--

Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA) is a process for applying to public/rights issues submitted by investors by blocking the application money in their bank account while subscribing to the issue.

C-ASBA will ensure centralized posting and verification of bank account numbers and DMAT account numbers ease monitoring of double application for issue managers and share registrars, cancellation of application upon double applications and prepare a final report for securities allocation.

C-ASBA is provided by (almost every) Banks in Nepal from all over its branches inside and outside Kathmandu. To avail the facility, just fill up the C-ASBA registration form and submit to (your) any nearest (Bank) branches.

### C-ASBA Registration Number

CRN is short form of C-ASBA Registration Number. It connect your bank account number with Demat Number. Due to which bank can easily block the amount of money you have applied for share application. Hence, CRN number of every individual is unique.

### Advantages in applying through C-ASBA

Applying through ASBA facility has the following advantages:

- The investor need not pay the application money by cheque rather the investor submits ASBA which accompanies an authorization to block the bank account to the extent of the application money.
- The investor does not have to bother about refunds, as in ASBA only that much money to the extent required for allotment of securities, is taken from the bank account only when his application is selected for allotment after the basis of allotment is finalized.
- The investor continues to earn interest on the application money as the same remains in the bank account, which is not the case in other modes of payment.
- The application form is simpler.
- The investor deals with the known intermediary i.e. its own bank.
