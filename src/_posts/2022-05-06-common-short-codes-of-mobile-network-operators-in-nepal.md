Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) brings directives to all mobile network operators to have a common short code for all mobile network operators (Namaste and Ncell) users to check balance, recharge balance, and transfer balance.

With the implementation of common shortcodes, you do not need to remember the shortcodes for all mobile network operators. You can use the same short code in any network to get the balance information in mobile, balance recharge, and balance transfer.

| Service          | Common Short Code |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Balance Recharge | 122               |
| Balance Transfer | 133               |
| Balance Inquiry  | 144               |

For example, dial USSD code `*144#` to check balance for all available SIM card networks in Nepal.

NTA has made such arrangements in telecommunication services by issuing shortcode and toll-free number management [procedures 2077 BS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gvzyk_Cd1RAnN1w0V0cVCFLkkw_DIwl4/view){:rel="nofollow"}.
