If you've just recently changed your date of birth, you may have to wait a few days before you can change it again. To help make sure that people are using their real identities on Facebook, there's a limit to how many times you can change your birthdate. Once you're able to change your birthday again, follow the steps here: [fb.com/help/563229410363824](https://www.facebook.com/help/563229410363824){:rel="nofollow"}.

But, **when you hit the limit** your profile will be locked to change your birthdate. **To change your locked birthdate** you can try to ask Facebook staff to do it for you.<br />
First log into your Facebook account (from your favourite web browser). **Click on this link ([fb.com/help/contact/233841356784195](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/233841356784195){:rel="nofollow"})** and select the day month and year of your birthday. Then type a short reason why you want to change your birthday. And click submit. Just in a few seconds Facebook will send a notification to your email and tells you that the Facebook team had changed it for you.
