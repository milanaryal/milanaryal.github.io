Keyboard shortcuts are keys or combinations of keys that provide an alternative way to do something that you'd typically do with a mouse. If you are trying to take a screenshot or screengrab, see [How to take and annotate screenshots](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-take-and-annotate-screenshots-on-windows-10-ca08e124-cc30-2579-3e55-6db63e36fbb9){:rel="nofollow"}.

Here's the list of Windows 10 shortcuts, and --- in addition --- some of our favorite "old but gold" shortcuts known from previous versions of Windows:

| Win + ⬅️Left/➡️Right/⬆️Up/⬇️Down | Position windows on your screen <br /> E.g. _Win + ⬅️Left_ moves the current window to the left half of your screen. If you use _Win + ⬆️Up_ afterwards, the current window will be placed in the upper left quarter of your screen. <br /> And, what's very handy in my opinion: If you release the Win key after positioning a window, Task View shows up on the opposite side of the positioned window to select and position another app. |
| Win + H                          | Share content (if supported by current app)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Win + X                          | Open _Start_ button context menu                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Win + G                          | Opens the Windows 10 _Game Bar_ to take game screenshots and record gaming videos of Windows 10 games (works in any game app, e.g. _Microsoft Solitaire Collection_)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

And, of course, these "old but gold" shortcuts known from previous Windows versions still work:

| Keyboard shortcut            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
