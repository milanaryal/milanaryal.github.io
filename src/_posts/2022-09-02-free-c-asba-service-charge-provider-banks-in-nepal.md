Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA) is a process for applying to public/rights issues submitted by investors by blocking the application money in their Bank account while subscribing to the issue.

C-ASBA will ensure centralized posting and verification of Bank account numbers and DMAT account numbers ease monitoring of double application for issue managers and share registrars, cancellation of application upon double applications and prepare a final report for securities allocation.
